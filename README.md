# The-Story-of-Timun-Mas
The Story of Timun Mas is a simple game featuring a Javanese folklore: Timun Mas. It is a story of a brave girl named Timun Mas that tries to escape and survive from an evil green giant that tried to catch and eat her.  I grew up reading tons of local folklore stories from various regions from Indonesia. Timun Mas is one of the earliest stories I read and have a special place in a lot of indonesian children's heart, including me. This story teaches us about responsibility, hope, and resilience. This playground was made with the hope for people to enjoy the story while learning the moral values using simple interactive game.  I hope you can enjoy this playground as much as I enjoy creating it! Have fun ðŸ˜†
